dimmer sticks:

login - rob or ms Kellogg


database of addresses to info

search feature -> filter for blank spaces

filter just one group

have the home screen dropdowns for groups?

make when mulitiple numbers one line    

make it editable - somehow mark if the changes were made by the other person?


add new instrument button -> changes screen to show only avaliable slots/chunks

ask rob/kellogg about archival!!

setup to move stuff?
'

basically make GitHub - pending changes in one menu -> once done irl confirm and then it changes in database

search: number just gives number / what instrument is assigned to it if any
can also search for instrument/electric -> will show all the numbers its assigned to



bank of addresses - global array of booleans
find all objects, loop through them, every spot taken make it false

when go to home route - if array.length is 0, run function to add something, update when add/edit

json file in public that i read and write to 
// Write to file

import fs from "fs";

fs.writeFileSync("data.json", JSON.stringify({ myArray: [1, 2, 3] }));

 

// Read from file

const data = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("data.json"));

console.log(data.myArray);


rob notes:


 write out full names for headings

show empty sections 


setup mobile access - make pending bar hide on open

MOBILE UI


JUST MAKE THE WHOLE THING A TABLE ACTUALLY - spots for location and instrument type



to do:

function to add new lights/instruments - done except for address numbers and user
make user autofill into there

fill blank spaces into dropdown - source from data base


make pending words depend on whether its new or edited

distinguish between universes?
