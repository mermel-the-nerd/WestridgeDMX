database of addresses to info

search feature -> filter for blank spaces

filter just one group

make when mulitiple numbers one line    

make it editable - somehow mark if the changes were made by the other person?


add new instrument button -> changes screen to show only avaliable slots/chunks

ask rob/kellogg about archival!!

'

basically make GitHub - pending changes in one menu -> once done irl confirm and then it changes in database

search: number just gives number / what instrument is assigned to it if any
can also search for instrument/electric -> will show all the numbers its assigned to




to do:
make light database + show in ui
function to add new lights/instruments
	show blank spaces
edit prexsisting lights
	also way to move addresses not just data
delete lights
change user
track changes
search
